> I've been looking for a modpack that would improve the game's performance for quite some time, so I decided to make my own and share it with the community.
> 
> If you'd like to try it out for yourself, I'll leave more information about the modpack below.
---
> ### _Disclaimer: i'm not the creator of the mods included in the modpack._
> _In the list of mods I will leave the links and credits to the creators._
---
> ### **Why use Angelo's Optimized?**
> There's really nothing special that sets Angelo's Optimized apart from other optimization modpacks. But I just wanted to share with the community the mods that helped me improve my Minecraft performance.
> Maybe they'll be useful to many others.
